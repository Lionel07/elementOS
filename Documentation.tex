\section{The note}
As you can see, in the directory \emph{\textbf{docs}}, there is a variety of .tex files. These files contain the developer documentation. These describe in \textbf{great} detail the inner workings of all implemented and non implemented parts of element. \emph{(-Corwin Mcknight; 5/13/13)}
\section{Building documentation}
Do a  \emph{\color{blue} make devdocs} in the root project folder. See, I do make things simple.
\section{Citation of edits}
In latex, simply do a \verb:\emph{(-[Your name here]; M/DD/YY)}:. This helps keep track of who edits what. The other convention you are recommended is in \emph{docs/conventions.tex}.
